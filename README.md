# Collective-Memory
Collective memory and attention are sustained by two channels: 
  oral communication (communicative memory) 
  and the physical recording of information (cultural memory)



Cristian Candia et al. gave a mathematic model to estimate the decay of collective memory.
Now, I'm trying to implement this project in python3.6
Estimate collective memory with survey data.
